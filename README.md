# PinStellix
PinStellix is an interactive web application that lets users explore space-related data from NASA and SpaceX APIs. Users can search for exoplanets, asteroids, rockets, and other celestial objects. Each item can be "pinned" to a personal collection, similar to creating a curated gallery of space wonders, and shared across social media platforms.
